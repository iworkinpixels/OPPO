OPPO
================================
OPPO is a Yamaha style "FM" synthesizer written in Python. I've done this as an exercise in learning Python and seeing if I can write the code and then get it ported to CircuitPython.

TODO:
* MAKE EVERYTHING AS FAST AS POSSIBLE! Turn divides into shifts where we can, eliminate the if tree when selecting the quadrant of the sine wave, and make it fast enough to at least have polyphony with 2OP patches.
* Implement Sine Wave Osc Using Lookup Tables
* Implement FM Algorithms
* Eliminate Click On Exit
* Implement Saving And Loading Of Patches
* Implement MIDI Input
