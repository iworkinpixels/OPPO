OPPO
================================
OPPO is a Yamaha style "FM" synthesizer written in Python. I've done this as an exercise in learning Python and seeing if I can write the code and then get it ported to CircuitPython.

TODO:
* Implement MIDI Over USB Input
* Implement FM Algorithms
* Optimize Sine Wave Osc Using Lookup Tables
* Eliminate Click On Exit
* Implement Saving And Loading Of Patches
